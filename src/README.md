# This is a simple game of PONG.

- Implemlented in Rust with pancuses (text mode) 
- Mostly as an exercice for C++ programmer.
- It is heavely 'self-ville', perhaps due to C++ programmer's bios.
- The game is playable by 2 people albeit due to console's input limitation the simultanious movments of paddles is not possible (using getch).
